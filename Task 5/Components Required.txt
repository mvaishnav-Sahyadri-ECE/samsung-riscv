Components Required:

Microcontroller – VSDsquadron mini

LEDs (at least 4) – To represent binary values and parity

Resistors (~220Ω for LEDs)

Push Buttons (3) – To simulate binary input (Here I simulated switch Manually)

Breadboard – For easy circuit assembly

Jumper Wires – For connections
